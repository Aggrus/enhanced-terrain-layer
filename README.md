# Terrain Layer
Adds a Terrain Layer to Foundry that can be used by other modules to calculate difficult terrain.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Currently you can draw a polygon onto the map to represent the terrain at that location.  You can then set how difficult that terrain is to move through, and what type of terrain it is, and if it affects ground based tokens or air based tokens.

The Terrain Layer will also let you assign difficulty to measured templates.  You can use this for spells that set difficult terrain.  And it will also calculate other tokens so that when you're moving through another creatures square it will count as difficult terrain.

Terrain Layer will show when a token is selected and dragged across the screen, staying out of sight until needed.  You can also set it so that it's always visible.

You can also set blocks of Terrain to be shown or not shown, so if the difficult terrain is only temporary or conditional you can control it.

## Credit
The orginal idea came from the Terrain Layer module.  But in the process of re-developing it I realised that none of the original code remained.  This is why I branched out into a new module.  But I want to give credit to the original author Will Saunders.
